# Bluetooth_Controlled_RobotCar_Using_Arduino
Abstract— In the past few months Bluetooth technology is
increasing dramatically with improving of Bluetooth
phones and other electronics items in our daily life. To
meet current requirements of several needs the
technology is already increased with help of remotecontrolled robotic cars via Bluetooth. So here open-source
hardware is used to designed and also developed a robotic
controlled car with the help of simple architecture. To
move a certain direction of our proposed design preinstalled command is used. In this paper android
application running on a Smartphone has been developed
with the help of user. This proposed design helps to
control the motion of the car remotely with the help of
Bluetooth kept feasible manner. Arduino act as main part
of the device which is controlled with the help of our
Smartphone via Bluetooth. So here Bluetooth act as a
main communicator between several controllers and our
Smartphone using protocols.
Keywords— Bluetooth Module, Bluetooth controlled Robot
Car, Arduino, Android Phone, Robot.
